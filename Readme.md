This tool can be used to check the binary classification performance data quality.
1. Given confusion matrix,  it can compute 13 performance measurements(including: FPR, FNR, TNR, ER, recall, precision, accuracy, FMeasure, MCC, GMeasure, GMean, Balance and defect density).
2. Given 2 or 3 performance measurements and defect density of a dataset, it can re-compute confusion matrix.
3. Check whether there is any data quality problem in binary classification performance measurement.
